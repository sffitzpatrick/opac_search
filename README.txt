# OPAC Search Block for Drupal

This is a simple module that provides a configurable search block that should pretty much work for any library catalog search that uses the GET method (i.e., if you can see the search query parameters in the URL, you should be good). 

Sure, you could just embed some html into a block yourself, but this module makes it really simple, and it utilizes Drupal's Form API (the "Drupal Way" of making forms).

After you install and enable the module, go to the block's config page and configure the following:

* Search URL, replacing the search term with [key].
* Placeholder text.
* Button text.

That's it! It's designed to be very simple, and if you need more robust functionality, the Custom Search module is a great option!
